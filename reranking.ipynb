Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance marine protected \\nareas are vital. \\nChapter 4: Mitigation and Adaptation \\nAddressing climate change requires a two-pronged approach: mitigation and adaptation. \\nMitigation involves reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases, while \\nadaptation involves making adjustments to social, economic, and environmental practices to \\nminimize the damage caused by climate change. \\nRenewable Energy'),\n",
